# CSCI 445 Assignment 3

# Important notes

* Left sphere is vertex-shaded. Right is Fragment-shaded.
* Both shaders are labeled in the index.html file:
    * vertex-shader-v is the vertex shader for the vertex-shaded objects, and the vertex-shader-f is the fragment shader for the same objects.
    * fragment-shader-v is the vertex shader for the fragment-shaded object, and the fragment-shader-f is the fragment shader for the object

* Completed everything; however, the sphere placement bugs out when going towards the edges of the canvas.
